### Why Cardano needs to exist

We want to build an ecosystem that is suitable for governments, corporates, and communities but immune to centralized abuse.
Cardano is a **public smart contract platform and monetary
system** that provides verifiable, censorship-resistant
infrastructure for societies and initiatives that cannot
afford to fail. Built upon foundational scientific
principles, peer-reviewed research, and the people who participate in its governance system.It is an auditable,
permissionless, and resilient public infrastructure stack
more inclusive than anything that came before.

### What we do, for whom, and in what distinct way

We provide infrastructure for coordination of resources, rights, and value at scale, **enabling participation in public systems demanding high-assurance** for communities, business and governments. 

We achieve this by offering a deterministic, composable, cost-effective, secure, verifiable and self-governing decentralized infrastructure,fostering an inclusive environment of value creation where participants create lasting impact.

### Where will we be if we pursue what we do successfully

By 2030, Cardano will be a leading infrastructure for public systems that demand high-assurance. Cardano will be a **sustainable
and economically self-sufficient ecosystem** of network-operators, projects,
services, and partners, demonstrating robust network utility
and widespread adoption through interoperability. This marks our commitment to
long-term viability, ensuring the network continually generates the
necessary resources to thrive.

### From Vision to Strategy

The aspiration of this Vision is translated into tangible
action through a comprehensive Strategic Plan. This plan
details how strategic imperatives, centered on secure
enterprise and national integration, culture-first
engagement, ecosystem cultivation, blockchain abstraction,
network health, core protocol advancement, and robust
financial stewardship, will guide our collective efforts.
Our commitment to this defined strategy ensures Cardano
remains a leading, dependable, and impactful platform for a
decentralized future, truly serving individuals and communities
globally.
