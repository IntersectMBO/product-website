### Why Cardano needs to exist

We want to build an ecosystem that is suitable for government and corporate use but immune to centralized abuse.
Cardano is a **public smart contract platform and monetary
system** that provides verifiable, censorship-resistant
infrastructure for societies and initiatives that cannot
afford to fail. Built upon foundational scientific
principles and peer-reviewed research, it is an auditable,
permissionless, and resilient public infrastructure stack
more inclusive than anything that came before.

### What we do, for whom, and in what distinct way

Cardano empowers **individuals, communities, businesses, and
governments** to coordinate resources, rights, and value at scale,
fostering an inclusive ecosystem where **builders and institutions**
create lasting impact. We achieve this by offering a deterministic,
composable, cost-effective, and self-governing infrastructure, enabling
secure and verifiable participation in public systems demanding
high-assurance, and cultivating an environment of value creation.

### Where will we be if we pursue what we do successfully

By 2030, Cardano will be the foundation of a **sustainable
and economically self-sufficient ecosystem** of projects,
services, and partners, demonstrating robust network utility
and widespread adoption. This marks our commitment to
long-term viability, ensuring the network continually generates the
necessary resources to thrive.

### From Vision to Strategy

The aspiration of this Vision is translated into tangible
action through a comprehensive Strategic Plan. This plan
details how strategic imperatives, centered on secure
enterprise and national integration, culture-first
engagement, ecosystem cultivation, blockchain abstraction,
network health, core protocol advancement, and robust
financial stewardship, will guide our collective efforts.
Our commitment to this defined strategy ensures Cardano
remains a leading, dependable, and impactful platform for a
decentralized future, truly serving individuals and communities
globally.
