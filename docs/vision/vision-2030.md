# Cardano 2030: Our Future, Defined

### Why Cardano needs to exist

Cardano exists to provide **trustworthy, censorship-resistant
infrastructure for societies and initiatives that cannot
afford to fail, built upon foundational scientific principles
and peer-reviewed research**. In a world where public
trust is collapsing, institutions are fragmenting, and digital
incentives often lead to extraction, Cardano offers a
composable layer for credible, long-term alternatives
without requiring permission to participate. It is about
enabling an auditable, permissionless, and resilient public
infrastructure stack more inclusive than anything that came
before.

### What we do, for whom, and in what distinct way

Cardano empowers **individuals and communities** to
coordinate resources, rights, and value at scale, fostering
an inclusive ecosystem where **builders and institutions**
create lasting impact. We achieve this by offering
deterministic, composable, self-governing infrastructure,
enabling secure and verifiable participation in public
systems demanding high-assurance, and cultivating an
environment for value creation, not extractive noise.

### Where will we be if we persue the mission successfully

By 2030, Cardano will be the foundation of a **sustainable
and economically self-sufficient ecosystem**, demonstrating
robust network utility and widespread adoption. This marks
our commitment to long-term viability, ensuring the network
continually generates the necessary resources to thrive.

### From Vision to Strategy

The aspiration of this Vision is translated into tangible
action through a comprehensive Strategic Plan. This plan
details how strategic imperatives, centered on secure
enterprise and national integration, culture-first
engagement, ecosystem cultivation, blockchain abstraction,
network health, core protocol advancement, and robust
financial stewardship, will guide our collective efforts.
Our commitment to this defined strategy ensures Cardano
remains a leading, dependable, and impactful platform for a
decentralized future, truly serving individuals and
communities globally.
