# Cardano 2030 Strategic Plan: The World's Operating System

## Executive Summary

This Strategic Plan aligns the Cardano ecosystem toward the Vision 2030, targeting **$200 million in annual Layer 1 (L1) revenue**. This ambition is rooted in Cardano's purpose: to provide trustworthy, censorship-resistant infrastructure built upon foundational scientific principles, ultimately enabling the emergence of **Digital Nation-States** and a **World's Operating System** where blockchain networks interoperate effortlessly.

Success hinges on a focused research agenda, robust on-chain demand, fostering meaningful transactions, and operationalizing an **evidence-based engineering methodology** across four strategic pillars: **Foundation, Adoption, Governance, and Sustainability.** Rigorous adherence to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is fundamental to achieving utility and economic self-sufficiency.
