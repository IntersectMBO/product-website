    particularly for organizations wary of "overhyped
    pilots" that don't deliver measurable value. This includes
    active engagement in policy and regulatory landscapes
    to foster equal access and broader understanding of
    non-financial blockchain use cases.

#### 5. Bolster SPO Incentives and Decentralization for Network Health

* **Diversify SPO Roles and Incentives:** Advance programs
    to incentivize Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and further
    decentralize infrastructure by enabling peer-to-peer
    transactions and allowing SPOs to determine their
    participation and earnings. Encourage SPOs to diversify
    roles beyond L1 block production, including supporting
    scalable off-chain value provision, oracle services, or
    decentralized hosting.
* **Optimize SPO Infrastructure and Registry:** Explore an
    SPO registry to list operators capable of supporting
    Layer 2 protocols or Actively Validated Services (AVS)
    for partner chains, informing future incentive
    mechanisms. Assess and optimize SPO incentive parameters
    to enhance network health and resilience. Ensure
    mechanisms are in place to support the continued
    participation and profitability of smaller SPOs, as
    they are crucial for true decentralization.
* **Sustainable L2 Expansion:** Design Layer 2 solutions
    to provide value back to the main chain (L1) through
    mechanisms like batching fees in ADA, preventing
    "leaching" and promoting sustainable growth of the
    broad Cardano ecosystem.

#### 6. Advance Core Protocol Capabilities for Scalability and
Efficiency

* **Achieve World-Class L1 Scalability and Finality:**
    Ensure the Layer 1 protocol can handle growing
    transaction volumes and provide rapid, secure
    transaction finality. This involves continuous
    advancement of core mechanisms to support high
    throughput and reliability, addressing any trade-offs
    in consensus complexity or network traffic.

    ecosystem-wide standardization and robust coordination
    processes for core protocol development to ensure unity,
    compatibility, and resilience across diverse client
    implementations. This includes developing robust
    conformance testing suites to mitigate risks of network
    partitioning and hard fork headaches.

#### 7. Establish Robust Ecosystem Financial Stewardship

* **Implement an Active, Managed Treasury:** Evolve the
    ecosystem's financial resources beyond a passive,
    single-asset treasury. Develop and implement a
    multi-asset, actively managed treasury designed to
    generate yields and strategically deploy capital to
    further ecosystem growth and sustainability. This
    addresses the need for sustained treasury replenishment
    beyond L1 transaction fees alone. It focuses on
    investments that lead to paying clients and meaningful
    transactions for long-term sustainability.
* **Support Strategic Investments in Ecosystem Health:**
    Proactively identify and financially support critical
    infrastructure providers and foundational applications
