## The Strategic Compass: Guiding Our Future

To realize our 2030 Vision, Cardano will focus on the
following strategic imperatives, informed by community input
and market demands:

### Foundation - Governance and Community

#### 1. Fostering a Culture-First Approach and Localized Engagement

* **Integrate Cultural Understanding:** Embed a
    culture-first approach as a foundational layer in all
    ecosystem development and product roadmap processes.
    This involves structured insight gathering on how users
    in diverse regions define trust, empowerment, and
    connection, informing local use case design, messaging,
    and onboarding strategies. This imperative directly
    supports revenue growth and widespread adoption by
    ensuring Cardano's solutions are relevant and embraced
    across diverse global communities.
* **Maintain a positive PR image of Cardano:** Actively
    address and counter negative messaging and perceptions
    of the ecosystem, particularly concerning community
    behavior and perceived instability. Cultivate a public
    narrative that emphasizes Cardano's architectural
    strength, product offerings, and collaborative spirit
    to ensure it is not dismissed by decision-makers due to
    external noise. Foster clear, unified representation
    by implementation partners.

#### 2. Maintain and evolve our governance processes

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Success will be measured by rigorous adherence to and tracking
of defined Key Performance Indicators:

* **DRep Participation:** 70% of DReps by stake participating in governance actions
* **Voter Delegation:** N% of stake delegated to DReps (and not always abstain)

### Pillars

#### 1. Adoption

##### 1. Verticals

* **Bitcoin Decentralized Finance:**
    *TODO* Abstract away from just Bitcoin, but keep the emphasis
    Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano unlocks the massive, passive
    liquidity of the world's largest cryptocurrency by
    transforming it into a productive financial asset.
    This provides a secure and efficient on-ramp for institutions
    and individuals to participate in decentralized lending,
    borrowing, and trading. By bridging the gap between traditional
    finance and the decentralized economy, Bitcoin DeFi is a critical
    use case that drives mainstream adoption and expands the financial
    utility of both ecosystems.

* **Real World Assets:**
    Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) bridges traditional finance
    and blockchain, representing a massive market opportunity. By
    converting ownership rights into digital tokens on an immutable ledger,
    RWA tokenization increases liquidity and accessibility for traditionally
    illiquid assets like real estate and fine art. This process streamlines
    operations, reduces costs, and speeds up settlement times by automating
    tasks with smart contracts. The enhanced transparency, stability, and
    potential for institutional adoption make RWA tokenization a critical use
    case for driving mainstream adoption of blockchain technology.

* **Supply Chain Traceability:**

    Cardano's immutable and transparent ledger provides a powerful solution for
    supply chain traceability. By leveraging blockchain, businesses can create a
    tamper-proof record of a product's journey from origin to consumer. This
    capability helps to prevent fraud and counterfeiting while building consumer
    trust and brand reputation. The use of transaction metadata allows a wide
    variety of information to be included with each transaction, such as location
    or a product's condition. By tokenizing products and linking them to unique
    identifiers like QR codes, companies can provide real-time visibility and a
    verifiable history. This streamlines operations, enhances accountability,
    and allows for rapid identification of issues, which is critical for targeted recalls.

* **Payments:**
    Cardano offers a fast, secure, and low-cost platform for global payments,
    with a specific focus on streamlining cross-border transactions for
    businesses and individuals. It uses native assets like stablecoins to bypass
    traditional financial intermediaries, leading to lower fees and faster settlement
    times. For high-volume, real-time payment needs, Cardano utilizes Layer 2 scaling
    solutions like the Hydra protocol. This technology allows for an unlimited number
    of off-chain transactions, enabling a wide range of use cases from high-frequency
    business payments and gaming to large-scale token distributions. Ultimately, this
    approach makes digital payments more accessible and appealing to small and
    medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which will help attract new users and increase
    liquidity within the ecosystem.


##### 2. End Users

* **Invisible Technology:** Ensure that for the vast
    majority of end-users, the underlying blockchain
    technology operates seamlessly and imperceptibly,
    functioning as a robust tool under the hood rather than
    a visible layer requiring specialized knowledge. As one
    partner noted, "Nobody cares about blockchain per se.
    What we care about is the applications."
* **Intuitive User Experience (UX):** Prioritize the
    development of dApps and services with UX design that
    mirrors familiar web2 applications, removing barriers
    associated with wallets, transaction signing, and fee
    management. This enables flexible payment methods,
    including stablecoin off-ramps, that significantly lower
    the barrier to entry for new users and businesses.
* **Enable Broad Accessibility and Participation:** Support
    mechanisms and tooling that allow users and operators to
    participate in the network and contribute to
    decentralization and security with minimal resource
    requirements. This includes a strategic emphasis on
    enabling an ease of participation.

##### 3. Developers

* **Improve Documentation:** Address
    fragmented developer documentation by creating
    consolidated, community-led resources with examples,
    videos, and clear onboarding paths. Simplify learning
    for complex blockchain concepts, making them accessible
    to a wider audience, including beginners.
* **Enable Seamless Decentralized Collaboration:** Cultivate
    effective platforms and processes that facilitate
    asynchronous collaboration, transparent feedback, and
    verifiable decision-making within a distributed and
    virtual environment. Implement strategies to sustain
    consistent engagement and high-quality contributions
    across diverse time zones and cultural backgrounds.
* **Provide Dedicated Growth Support for Key Applications:**
    Establish programs and resources to offer elite
    development and business development assistance to
    critical applications, facilitating their scaling, volume
    growth, and attracting new users and liquidity into the
    ecosystem. Foster collaboration among building teams
    over competition where shared goals exist.
* **Position as a Premier Development Platform:** Emphasize
    Cardano's capabilities as a leading development platform
    for diverse blockchain paradigms, attracting builders
    focused on high-value assets and unique programming models.
    Ensure marketing credibility by focusing on
    verifiable on-chain activity and demonstrable use cases.
* **Build Local Developer Capacity:** Focus on building
    local developer ecosystems in target markets to address
    talent shortages and reduce the cost of external expertise.
* **Empower Developers for Abstraction:** Provide
    developers with the standards, blueprints, tools and frameworks necessary to
    build applications that effectively abstract away
    blockchain complexities for their users, allowing them
    to focus on delivering value and functionality. This
    includes addressing foundational friction in the
    developer journey to streamline the builder experience
    and make development as attractive as competing platforms.

##### 4. Businesses, Organizations and Governments

* **Prioritize Application-Level Security:** Address the
    critical concern of application-level security on public
    blockchains, which is a non-starter for major
    corporations. Cardano's design, built upon
    foundational scientific principles and peer-reviewed
    research, positions it as the only viable option for
    serious companies demanding the highest assurance. This
    requires developing and integrating advanced security
    capabilities that provide a secure environment for large
    enterprises and national entities to interact with
    Cardano without compromising their stringent standards.
    This includes ensuring compliance with established risk
    mitigation frameworks (e.g., SOC 1/2, ESA 341 types, MiCA).
* **Streamline Financial and Operational Integration &
    Onboarding:** Facilitate seamless enterprise and national
    adoption by simplifying treasury management, invoicing,
    and financial reporting on Cardano. This includes
    addressing accounting, auditing, and tax reporting
    requirements, potentially through tools that bridge
    blockchain data with traditional financial software.
    The focus is on providing a plug-in layer that integrates
    with existing legacy systems, rather than requiring
    their replacement. Support for stablecoin and real-world
    asset (RWA) tokenization, with a focus on illiquid
    assets, is seen as a key long-term opportunity.
* **Proactively Drive Business Development:** Systematically
    identify and pursue strategic partnerships with leading
    enterprises and national entities across target verticals.
    Grants and co-funded pilots from the ecosystem's
    treasury are a critical tool to lower the barrier for
    engagement and overcome internal resource constraints.
    This includes active engagement in policy and regulatory landscapes
    to foster equal access and broader understanding of
    non-financial blockchain use cases.

##### 5. Emerging Markets

    Prioritize identifying and collaborating with key local
    individuals and partners who can facilitate
    understanding and communication within their respective
    cultures. This includes leveraging local organizers for
    global workshops, ensuring a wider range of
    perspectives and insights into diverse market needs are
    captured. Develop distinct strategies for effective
    virtual and in-person engagement, recognizing the
    limitations of hybrid approaches. Invest in
    professional interpreters who understand subject matter
    and context, ensuring accurate cross-cultural
    communication. Acknowledge and adapt to
    cultural nuances, including religious perspectives on
