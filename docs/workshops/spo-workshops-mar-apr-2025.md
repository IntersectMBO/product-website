# Unpacking the Future: Key Insights from Recent SPO Workshops

The recent Stake Pool Operator (SPO) workshops on March 26th and
April 3rd, 2025, provided invaluable insights into the challenges and
opportunities facing the Cardano network and its dedicated SPO community.
Discussions spanned critical topics from operational sustainability and
decentralization to future business models and protocol evolution. Here's a
look at the key takeaways:

## Navigating the Operational Landscape

SPOs, particularly smaller or newer ones, continue to grapple with
infrastructure costs. While experienced operators find
installation easy, newcomers face a steeper learning curve. A
significant concern is the high reliance on cloud services (over 90% of
nodes), posing a considerable centralization risk to the network.
Many SPOs prefer bare metal setups for their long-term cost-effectiveness
and decentralization benefits, often employing hybrid models for
failover.

A persistent issue is the presence of "dead pools" with inactive stake,
which reduce network efficiency and distort staking incentives. The
"stickiness" of delegation also makes it difficult for new or small pools to
attract and retain delegators.

## The Core of Sustainability: Incentives and Profitability

SPO profitability is under threat, with staking rewards declining faster
than new fee mechanisms can compensate. This creates a negative
feedback loop: less staking participation leads to fewer rewards, further
discouraging staking. To combat this, a proposal was made to
emit full rewards each epoch without returning any portion to reserves,
aiming to stabilize rewards and improve short-term viability.

There's broad support for transitioning towards a minimum margin model
instead of the current minimum pool cost, which disproportionately penalizes
smaller pools. Suggested adjustments include linking the
minimum pool cost dynamically to the ADA price. Reducing taxes
from 20% to 10% was also suggested to boost delegator rewards and
attractiveness.

The pledge mechanism is viewed as capital inefficient, with ideas surfacing
to de-emphasize its role. Furthermore, compound rewards on lost
ADA are a long-term risk that might necessitate expiring delegation
certificates to prevent distortion.

## Building for Tomorrow: Business Opportunities & Network Expansion

SPOs are actively exploring new revenue streams to ensure long-term
sustainability. These include offering infrastructure for
sidechains like Hydra heads, Midgard validators, and Midnight nodes,
as well as engaging in partnerships with new projects and DeFi initiatives
. Rollups with settlement on Layer 1 are preferred over standalone
partnerchains for potential additional revenue. Transaction
prioritization services and providing critical infrastructure
beyond standard block production were also highlighted as
potential opportunities.

While direct fiat on/off ramps and stablecoin swaps would be helpful for
operational flexibility, they aren't seen as immediate blockers.
Increased transaction volume, perhaps via a BTC bridge, is viewed as a
sustainable way to boost rewards.

## Enhancing the User Experience & Marketing Cardano

Effective marketing for individual SPOs is challenging, with low ROI on
paid campaigns. Personal branding and visibility are considered
the most effective tactics. There's a strong call for a better
on-chain experience, including improved wallet guidance for staking and a
more intuitive pool discovery user experience. General Cardano
marketing, emphasizing staking as a utility for new users, is seen as more
beneficial than marketing individual pools.

## Decentralization and Infrastructure Evolution

The workshops reinforced the importance of decentralization. Beyond the
cloud concentration risk, additional infrastructure for dApp processing is
needed to avoid single points of failure. Future bandwidth
demands from initiatives like Mithril and LAOs may further enhance the
attractiveness of bare metal setups. Suggestions also included
allowing optional node compilation to avoid bloated binaries and improve
security.

## Shaping the Future: Governance and Protocol Parameters

There's a strong desire for more rapid iteration of key parameters like K,
taxes, and reward models. Improving delegator rewards is a high
priority. The current governance process (DRep voting) is seen as
suboptimal for managing operator-specific parameters like fees.

These workshops underscore the vibrant and engaged nature of the Cardano SPO
community, actively working to address current challenges and innovate for a
more decentralized and sustainable future.
