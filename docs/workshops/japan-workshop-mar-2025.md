# Connecting with the Community in Japan - March 2025

## Introduction

From March 8th to 13th, 2025, pivotal workshops took place across Japan,
focusing on Cardano's Vision, Roadmap, and Budget process. Organized by
Intersect, with key figures from the US and supported by local organizers,
these aimed to deepen engagement with the Japanese Cardano community. This
article shares key insights and learnings from this important initiative.

## The Workshops: A Deep Dive

Held in Tokyo, Fukuoka, and Nagoya, the workshops fostered collaboration and
gathered feedback on Cardano's strategic direction. Community members and
local DRep representatives participated in presentations, discussions, and an
A-F rating activity on roadmap and budget items. Goals included aligning
development with the Japanese community's needs, encouraging governance
participation, and expanding the ecosystem within Japan.

## Key Learnings and Insights:

* **Language Matters:** Reliance on Google Translate highlighted the need for
  professional translation or bilingual facilitators.
* **Hybrid Ineffectiveness:** The Tokyo hybrid workshop showed the value of
  separate in-person and virtual events.
* **Planning is Paramount:** Rushed planning impacted participation, stressing
  early and thorough preparation.
* **Direct Feedback is Invaluable:** The A-F rating provided actionable
  insights into community priorities.
* **Community Engagement Drives Success:** Direct engagement strengthens
  community bonds and fosters ownership.
* **Cultural Nuances:** Awareness of cultural differences is essential for
  effective communication.
* **Vision Alignment:** Strong support for Cardano's original vision,
  especially banking the unbanked and interest in Africa/LATAM.
* **Governance Desire:** A strong desire for participation in Cardano's future
  governance.
* **Decentralization Priority:** Maintaining and improving decentralization is a
  key concern.
* **Global Strategic Advantage:** Cardano's global presence, including the
  Japanese community, is a strategic asset.
* **Regional Diversity:** The Japanese Cardano community varies significantly
  by region.
* **Demographic Considerations:** The older demographic presents a challenge
  in attracting younger members.
* **Founding Entity Trust:** High trust exists in Cardano's founding entities.
* **Daedalus Priority:** Ongoing maintenance of Daedalus is crucial for the
  community.

## Challenges Faced:

Challenges included translation difficulties, technical issues with the hybrid
format, cultural differences, and the impact of rushed planning. These
provided valuable lessons for future events.

## The Future of Cardano in Japan:

The workshops demonstrated the vibrant and engaged nature of the Japanese
Cardano community. Their dedication to the original vision, desire for
governance participation, and focus on decentralization are crucial.
Addressing the demographic challenge and ensuring effective communication
will be key to continued growth.

## Conclusion:

These workshops strengthened the relationship between Intersect and the
Japanese Cardano community. The insights gained will inform future strategies
and ensure Cardano's continued growth in Japan. Understanding and addressing
the community's unique needs will solidify Cardano's global presence and
achieve its vision of a more equitable and decentralized future.
