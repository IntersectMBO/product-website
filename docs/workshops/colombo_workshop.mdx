### Why Cardano Needs to Exist

Cardano exists to provide a trustworthy, decentralized, and transparent infrastructure that empowers individuals, supports global fairness, and serves both institutional and everyday users. Built on a research-driven foundation with formal verification, deterministic finality, and a predictable upgrade process, Cardano offers a scalable, energy-efficient public platform. Its proof-of-stake model, with staking and delegation, ensures resilience and open participation, while decentralized governance and parameterization limits protect against centralized abuse.

As a smart contract platform and settlement layer supporting native assets (ADA) and tokenization, Cardano enables censorship-resistant, auditable, and permissionless infrastructure for real-world applications like identity, supply chain, and DeFi. Its focus on interoperability and cross-chain interaction fosters self-sustaining evolution, ensuring compliance where needed. By 2025, Cardano aims to be faster and more developer-friendly, and by 2030, a sustainable global ecosystem serving millions with provable security, transparent governance, and accessible financial systems.

#### Comments made by the attendees

CI: By 2025, Cardano will be faster, easier to build on, and more useful for real-world applications. By 2030, it will be a global, sustainable ecosystem serving millions worldwide.

  

SF: Scalable, energy‑efficient public infrastructure. Proof‑of‑stake with staking/delegation, ongoing scaling (e.g., input endorsers, Hydra layer‑2). Supports mainstream apps and payments sustainably, with open participation for users and validators.

SF: Long‑term governance, interoperability, and real‑world use. Enable self‑sustaining evolution, cross‑chain interaction, and real‑world deployments (identity, supply chain, DeFi) that can comply where needed.

YR: Cardano needs to exist because it is one of the ecosystem where everyone's voice is heard and valued

RD: It is a trustworthy and more transparent platform which is decentralized.And also with the research-driven foundation it ensures the resilience as well

SW: Cardano exists to provide trustworthy, decentralised infrastructure that everyone can trust

WS: Strong in connecting mission, vision, and strategy, but it could be sharper if it also emphasizes Cardano’s role in creating real-world opportunities—like financial access, trust in digital systems, and empowerment for everyday users, not only institutions.

SM: Strong wording. Briefly explain the mechanisms (decentralized governance, staking/delegation model, parameterization limits, client diversity) that make “immune” credible.

SF: If you mean native asset (ADA), settlement layer, and tokenization, say so. Otherwise, readers may assume full retail/CBDC functionality.

SS: could be improved by mentioning its mission to empower individuals and drive fairness in global systems, not just serve corporations and governments.

WL: Temper the absolutism or anchor it in properties (formal verification options, deterministic finality characteristics, predictable upgrade process) rather than a blanket claim.

  

SF: Good differentiator. Add a liner on what this yields (provable security of consensus, upgrade governance, formal specs).

TS : I think this makes a strong case for why Cardano is needed.

### What we do, for whom, and in what distinct way

Cardano provides a secure, verifiable, and censorship-resistant public smart contract platform and monetary system that empowers individuals, communities, businesses, and governments to create, manage, and exchange value. We serve individuals and communities seeking open access to secure digital services and finance, builders and businesses developing interoperable applications and programmable assets, and public agencies and enterprises requiring compliant, transparent, and durable infrastructure. Our distinct approach combines scientific foundations, decentralized governance, composable design, and cost-effective scalability to deliver a reliable, future-proof ecosystem that simplifies blockchain for newcomers, fosters trust through auditable outcomes, and drives real-world adoption.

#### Comments made by the attendees

FN: We provide a public smart contract platform and monetary system that delivers secure, verifiable, and censorship-resistant infrastructure.

CI: The section is strong in showing who Cardano serves and its unique features, but it’s a bit too technical and wordy. Simplifying the language and focusing more on real-world outcomes would make it clearer and more engaging.

SF: What we do: Provide verifiable, censorship‑resistant infrastructure for applications, assets, and identity where outcomes can be audited, not merely trusted.

For whom: Individuals and communities seeking open access to secure digital services and finance. Builders and businesses creating interoperable applications and programmable assets. Public agencies and enterprises that require compliant, durable, and transparent infrastructure.

Distinct way: Scientific foundations, decentralized governance, composability and assurance, and cost‑effective scalability.

RD: Cardano continuously innovates and adapts its platform with emerging technologies to remain reliable, relevant and future-proof

SS: This section effectively shows Cardano’s broad impact and strong infrastructure, but could stand out more by emphasizing efforts to make blockchain simple for newcomers, which will help grow the ecosystem naturally and make real-world adoption easier.

YR: It could be improved by providing clearer explanation of what makes Cardano distinct

TS: I think there is a need for clearer educational resources to help people and institutions understand and trust the value of blockchain technology

### Where will we be if we pursue what we do successfully

By 2030, Cardano will serve as the leading public infrastructure layer for high-assurance digital services, powering a sustainable and economically self-sufficient ecosystem of projects, services, and partners. This ecosystem will demonstrate robust network utility through widespread adoption by millions of users, thousands of decentralized applications (dApps), and large-scale enterprise and government implementations. Enterprises will integrate Cardano into their financial systems, product ecosystems, and compliance workflows, while governments will leverage it for transparent registries, secure voting, welfare distribution, and other critical functions where failure or corruption is unacceptable. A vibrant developer ecosystem, supported by mature tooling, multiple client implementations, and strong standards for security and interoperability, will drive innovation. Cardano’s measurable resilience will be evident through diverse validator and stake pool distribution, transparent service-level agreements (SLAs), and robust incident-response practices. By enabling accessible, secure, and decentralized infrastructure, Cardano will lower compliance costs and foster inclusion for citizens and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), offering credible, open alternatives to closed platforms in

finance, identity, and supply chains, with nation-scale impact in both emerging and advanced economies.

#### Comments made by the attendees

FN: Enterprise & Government Adoption at Scale Enterprises integrate Cardano into their financial systems, product ecosystems, and compliance workflows. Governments leverage Cardano for transparent registries, voting, welfare distribution, and other functions where failure or corruption cannot be tolerated. Adoption will extend beyond pilots into nation-scale implementations in emerging and advanced economies.

CI: It clearly shows Cardano’s long-term goal of being sustainable and widely adopted, but it’s too broad adding concrete outcomes (users, dApps, adoption by institutions) would make it stronger.

LK : Agree. It is a strong and realistic goal

SF : If we execute our mission well, Cardano becomes the default public infrastructure layer for high‑assurance digital services - trusted by everyday users, adopted by builders and businesses at scale, and credible to governments that require transparency without central control.

-   Broad adoption
    
-   Institutional trust
    
-   Builder gravity: vibrant developer ecosystem with mature tooling, multiple client implementations, and strong standards for security and interoperability
    
-   Sustainable governance
    
-   Measurable resilience: diverse validator/stake pool distribution, transparent SLAs, and incident‑response practices
    
-   Real‑world impact: lower cost of compliance and inclusion for citizens and SMEs; credible, open alternatives to closed platforms in finance, identity, and supply chains
    

RD: Cardano's global impact by enabling access to secure, decentralized infrastructure will increase the real world value for high assurance systems without centralized control.

YR: The future of Cardano has been beautifully described.

SR: This section is fine as is, clearly outlining Cardano's 2030 vision of a sustainable ecosystem, though briefly noting accessibility and innovation would add appeal

CI: it is good

SW: Agree with this statment. Current trejectory will lead to mass adoption across the baord including developing countuties. Adoption can also lead to larger contributions towards the ecosystem and in turn help multiple industries worldwide.

TS: I think we might need to explain a bit more about what this means for the industries, possibly in a different section.

WS: This section effectively conveys Cardano’s long-term ambition and commitment to sustainability. I appreciate the emphasis on creating a self-sufficient ecosystem with robust network utility and widespread adoption. It might be helpful to include examples of key metrics or milestones that will indicate success by 2030, which could make the vision even more concrete and actionable.

### From Vision to Strategy

Our vision for Cardano becomes reality through a clear Strategic Plan, turning intent into action with seven priorities: secure enterprise and government integrations, inclusive community engagement, ecosystem growth via developer enablement, user-friendly blockchain tools, resilient network operations, research-driven protocol advancements, and transparent financial stewardship. Progress will be tracked with KPIs, timelines, and pilot projects, while addressing risks through collaboration. This focused strategy ensures Cardano remains a trusted, innovative platform, empowering individuals and communities globally.

#### Comments made by the attendees

CI: Clear connection from vision to action, highlighting key focus areas, but it’s wordy and complex simplifying would make it easier to understand.

SM: Our vision becomes reality through a focused Strategic Plan that turns intent into execution. It aligns the ecosystem around seven strategic pillars:

(1) secure enterprise and national‑scale integrations

(2) culture‑first community engagement and governance

(3) ecosystem growth through developer enablement and partnerships

(4) blockchain abstraction that makes Cardano easy to build on and integrate (5) network health and resilience across clients, stake pools, and operations (6) continuous core protocol advancement grounded in research

(7) disciplined financial stewardship via transparent treasury and funding by delivering against these priorities, Cardano will remain a trusted, high‑assurance public platform - serving individuals, builders, and institutions globally while advancing a decentralized future. i think It's a solid and well-structured statement

RD: Would be better if added specific indicators to show whether the strategy is working.

YR : I think it is good but can improve in the wordings

SW: Work with gov and companies to impliment pilot projects and form kpis to track progress

LK: I think It's a solid and well-structured statement

RD: Would be better if added specific indicators to show whether the strategy is working.

YR: I think it is good but can improve in the wordings

SW: Work with gov and companies to impliment pilot projects and form kpis to track progress

WS: The vision does a great job of turning big ideas into a clear strategy, showing how Cardano plans to grow its network, support communities, and stay financially strong. I like the focus on enterprise integration, network health, and community engagement.

To make it even better, it might help to:

-   Show clear ways to measure progress, like specific goals or milestones.
    
-   Include a timeline or roadmap so it’s clear what comes first.
    
-   Explain how communities, developers, and partners will be involved.
    
-   Mention any potential risks and how they’ll be handled.
    
-   Use simpler language for terms like “blockchain abstraction” or “robust financial stewardship.”
    
-   Give real examples of projects or partnerships that will put this strategy into action.
    
-   Overall, it’s inspiring and gives a strong sense of direction. Adding these details would make it easier for anyone to understand how the strategy will actually work in practice.
    

## SESSION 2 - Strategy

During this session, we briefly reviewed the Cardano 2030 Strategic Plan within the allocated time. The majority of attendees felt that the plan already addressed many of the key concerns raised during the workshop, and overall coverage was seen as sufficient. A smaller number of participants suggested targeted edits and enhancements to sharpen the focus in specific areas.

The feedback below reflects both the strong alignment with community expectations and the constructive suggestions offered to strengthen the strategy further.

Comments made by the attendees for,

### 1. Abstract Blockchain Complexity for Mass Adoption

The participants agreed this section is clear, well written, and effectively conveys Cardano's strategy. No changes needed!

### 2. Fostering a Culture-First Approach and Localized Engagement

The participants were particularly concerned with the use of the word “log-hanging” to describe countries and their economies. Some of the comments from some of the participants are added below.

SF : The phrase "low-hanging fruit" can come across as dismissive or exploitative when applied to countries facing economic or social challenges. It implies that these markets are easy targets for adoption due to their vulnerabilities, which could feel patronizing or insensitive to the complex realities of these regions. A more neutral or respectful term, like "high-potential markets" or "priority markets," might better convey strategic focus without reducing these countries to opportunities for quick wins.

RD: Rather than saying “low-hanging fruit” markets , it is better to focus on markets already embracing crypto and additionally also not forgetting the countries which have the most active blockchain communities such as in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Pakistan ect.

### 3. Cultivate a Vibrant, Skilled, and Engaged Ecosystem

The participants agreed this section is clear, well written, and effectively conveys Cardano's strategy. No changes needed!

### 4. Drive Enterprise & National Adoption: Secure & Value-Additive Integration

The participants agreed this section is clear, well written, and effectively conveys Cardano's strategy. No changes needed!

### 5. Bolster SPO Incentives and Decentralization for Network Health

Most of the participants did not want this point to be included in this document. Some participants mentioned if SPO compensation were to be discussed here, they would then like to see other stakeholders in Cardano like DReps etc get mentioned as well.

Some comments are included.

Anonymous:  This is not needed, cardano already has achieved excellent decentralisation, meaning the  system in place to compensate SPOs is working well enough.  If there is considerable drop in SPO activity, an emergency fund could be activated to support  long term spos until a better solution is found. This is not a point that needs so much  attention for it to be included in the vision.

  

WS: As an innovation opportunity, SPOs could offer additional value-added services through blockchain-based APIs or AI-driven automation, such as smart routing for enterprise transactions, blockchain-based credit card integration, or AI-assisted dApp hosting on Layer 2. This would diversify SPO revenue streams, enhance decentralization, and drive broader adoption of advanced services.

### 6. Advance Core Protocol Capabilities for Scalability and Efficiency

WS: Consider integrating AI-driven tools to monitor and optimize L1 and L2 protocols, enabling dynamic scaling, predictive congestion management, and automated protocol adjustments to enhance scalability, reduce latency, and support complex applications.

### 7. Establish Robust Ecosystem Financial Stewardship

WS: Consider an innovative treasury approach that integrates AI-powered management, predictive analytics, and programmable funding streams, combined with tokenized ecosystem bonds. This would dynamically allocate capital to high-impact projects, maximize yield, incentivize participation, and proactively sustain ecosystem health and long-term resilience.
