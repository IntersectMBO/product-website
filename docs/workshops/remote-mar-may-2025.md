# Glimpses of 2030: Key Insights from Our Recent Remote Workshops

We recently wrapped up a series of engaging remote workshops in
March, April, and May 2025, bringing together diverse voices to
envision the future and explore Cardano's role within it. These
discussions provided invaluable insights into macro trends,
potential opportunities, and the challenges we must collectively
address.

A recurring and dominant theme across all workshops was the
**inevitable convergence of AI and blockchain technology**.
Participants consistently highlighted that by 2030, AI will be
deeply integrated into daily life, from anticipating our needs via
smartphones to revolutionizing healthcare, entertainment, and
education. This pervasive AI presence underscores the
critical need for blockchain's capabilities in **traceability of
knowledge** used by AI and combating the growing threat of
**deepfakes**. There's a clear call for cooperative
ownership of AI providers to democratize its benefits.

The workshops also painted a picture of a world facing significant
challenges. We anticipate localized worsening due to **climate
change, resource scarcity, wealth disparities, and geopolitical
fragmentation**. This evolving landscape positions
blockchain as an **"antifragile" technology**, offering resilience
and new forms of trust in an unstable world.

## Cardano's Opportunities in a Changing World

Our community identified several key areas where Cardano can make a
profound impact:

* **Identity and Public Records**: A strong consensus emerged
    around leveraging blockchain for **digital IDs, birth
    certificates, land deeds, and testaments**, with Miami cited as
    an example of early adoption. This extends to
    public service records and digital ID renewals.
    Decentralized identity is seen as foundational for
    self-sovereign individuals and nations.
* **Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization**: There's significant
    enthusiasm for **tokenized real estate** and
    cooperative ownership models for real estate and other assets
   .
* **Financial Inclusion and Micro-transactions**: Participants
    emphasized enabling true **micro-transactions** and
    providing trustless savings and lending for the unbanked,
    especially in emerging markets like Africa. Cardano
    is uniquely positioned to offer low-cost mobile solutions for
    financial inclusion.
* **Transparent Governance and Voting**: Blockchain's potential
    for **transparent voting systems** was highlighted repeatedly
   , seen as a crucial tool to rebuild trust in
    electoral processes globally. There's also a
    desire for Cardano's governance model to become an exportable
    standard for external institutions.
* **Supply Chain and Authenticity**: Tracking provenance and
    ensuring the authenticity of goods through blockchain was
    identified as a strong use case.
* **AI Integration**: Beyond just data traceability, there's a
    strong desire for Cardano to support **smart contracts
    integrating AI** and to establish guardrails for AI
    integration and machine governance.

## Addressing the Barriers to Adoption

While the opportunities are vast, the workshops also brought to
light critical barriers to mass adoption:

* **Education and Awareness**: A fundamental barrier is the **lack
    of education and awareness** among both the public and builders
    regarding blockchain's benefits and how to utilize the
    technology effectively. There's a clear need for an
    education-first approach to drive adoption.
* **User Experience (UX) and Onboarding**: A significant hurdle
    remains the **poor UX of blockchain applications**
    and the fragmented, unclear entry points into Web3 for
    mainstream audiences. The goal is for blockchain
    to function like the internet, with users unaware of the
    underlying technology.
* **Regulatory Uncertainty and Government Resistance**:
    Participants noted that **regulation remains a barrier** and anticipate active resistance from governments and
    large companies that may see their power reduced by
    decentralized systems.
* **Scalability**: While Layer 2 solutions are seen as essential
    for transaction volume growth, the **Layer 1 (L1)
    must scale in parallel** to support these ecosystems securely
   .
* **Preparing for Quantum Computing**: While the first quantum
    computers are anticipated by 2030, bringing a
    potential long-term threat to current encryption methods, the community highlighted a need to prioritize other
    immediate challenges like UX, onboarding, and regulatory
    clarity. Nevertheless, developing **quantum-resistant
    cryptography** for Cardano remains an important consideration
    for long-term security and resilience.

## The Path Forward for Cardano

The workshops underscored a clear call for Cardano to focus its
vision around identity, public records, real-world asset
tokenization, financial inclusion, and AI integration.
The community wants Cardano to remain accessible, secure, and
competitive in a rapidly changing, AI-driven world.

Key strategic takeaways include:

* **Differentiating Cardano**: Position Cardano as a
    **trustworthy, sustainable, and long-term player** in the
    blockchain space, overcoming past perceptions of scams and poor
    projects. Its L1 should be promoted as enterprise-
    grade infrastructure â€“ secure, reliable, and immutable.
* **Balancing Research and Execution**: A desire to "research
    less, launch more" was expressed, emphasizing the need for
    practical tools and go-to-market support for builders.
* **Community and Inclusivity**: Maintaining Cardano's reputation
    as a "people's hub" with an inclusive and globally aware
    community is crucial. Collaborative workshops and
    open discussion processes are highly valued.

These workshops have provided a robust foundation for shaping
Cardano's future, ensuring it remains relevant and impactful in the
transformative years ahead. We thank all participants for their
invaluable contributions and look forward to continuing these vital
conversations.
