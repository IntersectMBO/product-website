# Future of Cardano: Key Insights from the Quebec City Workshop

Quebec City recently hosted a pivotal "Future of Cardano Workshop"
led by Mike Hornan. It gathered a diverse group from six
countries, four continents, and ten different blockchains.
The workshop included one re-elected initial constitution committee
member and two newly elected constitutional committee members. The session
delved into various governance scenarios and protocol
behaviors within the Cardano ecosystem. It utilized
interactive "What If?" scenarios to challenge attendees' understanding
of governance actions, committee transitions, protocol parameter
changes, and treasury withdrawals.

## Understanding Cardano's Governance Mechanics

The workshop provided crucial clarifications on several aspects of
Cardano's governance. Mike Hornan used a "What If?" scenario-based
learning approach to engage attendees. These scenarios
explored how the Cardano ledger would behave in potential future
situations involving governance actions. Key discussions
focused on the mechanics of committee member removal,
voting thresholds, the impact of committee
replacements on active governance actions, and the
technical nuances of credential management. The
workshop clarified several protocol behaviors, highlighted
potential pitfalls in governance processes, and
emphasized the importance of timely credential updates.

## Intersect Product Committee's 2030 Vision

Following the governance discussions, the Intersect Product Committee
held a workshop to refine Cardano's long-term vision for 2030. Building upon the previously established 2025 vision and
roadmap, the committee is gathering extensive input through in-person,
virtual, and self-run workshops. These efforts also
include business interviews with various Cardano ecosystem
participants and external businesses.

A significant outcome of these discussions is the consensus to distill
the current verbose draft vision document (originally around 39 pages)
into a concise 1â€“1.5-page document. The focus is on
creating an actionable and easily digestible vision. While
various targets were proposed, the only one that gained general
consensus as a good goal for 2030 was $200 million in annual L1
transaction fees.

## Addressing Challenges and Fostering Growth

The workshops highlighted several key challenges and opportunities for
Cardano's future:

* **Enterprise Adoption Barriers:** Legal, financial, and regulatory
    hurdles were identified as primary blockers for enterprise adoption
   . The need to engage with accountants,
    auditors, and legal advisors to address compliance concerns was
    emphasized. An example cited Norway's largest
    bank, which required 1,000 employees to undergo chain analyst
    training before integrating with crypto exchanges,
    highlighting the need to fix legal and financial onboarding
    barriers.

* **Cultural Intelligence and Local Partnerships:** A strong consensus
    emerged on the necessity of integrating "cultural intelligence" as a
    foundational layer for product-market fit within the product roadmap
    process. This involves structured insight gathering
    around how target users find trust, empowerment, and connection, informing local use case design, messaging, and onboarding
    strategy. The importance of professional interpreters who
    understand the subject matter, and not just language, was also
    stressed.

* **Developer Onboarding and Education:** The current state of
    fragmented developer documentation was identified as a significant
    issue. The need for centralized,
    community-led documentation with examples, images, videos, and clear
    onboarding paths was emphasized.
    Educational outreach, particularly targeting youth and schools through
    pilot programs and school clubs, was proposed as a strategy to engage
    younger generations and promote blockchain literacy.

* **SPO Incentives and Decentralized Infrastructure:** The "icebreakers"
    program was discussed as a means to incentivize SPOs and further
    decentralize infrastructure. The long-term
    vision for this program is to enable peer-to-peer transactions and
    allow SPOs to determine their participation levels and earnings,
    ultimately contributing to a fully decentralized network.
    The concept extends to diversifying node operator roles beyond just
    block production, including running Midgard validators,
    Hydra nodes, oracles, or hosting services
   , fostering a more robust and interconnected Cardano
    ecosystem.

The workshop concluded with a strong encouragement for participants to
utilize SanchoNet for further testing of governance scenarios. The overarching sentiment was to focus on a concise,
high-level vision with measurable targets and supporting strategies,
while also identifying and leveraging "low-hanging fruit" markets that
are already embracing crypto.
