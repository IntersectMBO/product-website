to guide future strategic decisions.

### Leios: Exploring Layer 1 vs. Layer 2 Implementation

A significant part of the afternoon discussion focused on Leios and its
potential role within the Cardano ecosystem. While its potential as a Layer 1
enhancement to increase throughput was acknowledged, several participants
raised the question of whether implementing Leios as a Layer 2 solution might
offer certain advantages. The rationale behind this consideration included
the idea that operating Leios as an L2 could allow nodes with varying
capacity or resource constraints to choose whether or not to run it.
Furthermore, it was suggested that an L2 implementation might make it easier
to manage and potentially 'ignore' Leios functionality when the increased
throughput is not immediately required by the network. This perspective
highlights the ongoing evaluation of the optimal architectural integration
for Leios within the broader Cardano ecosystem.

### Marketing Cardano: Defining Core Properties

A focused discussion on marketing strategies took place towards the end of the
workshop, involving a dialogue about how to best position Cardano in the
coming years. Participants considered the three main properties that Cardano
should be known for. While "decentralization" is a core tenet, there was a
suggestion to potentially subsume it under the broader umbrella of "security"
for clearer marketing messaging. One participant proposed the key attributes
of "Secure, Predictable, and Fast" as a concise and impactful way to classify
Cardano in the future.

## Advancing Cardano's Capabilities

### Stake Pool Operator (SPO) Incentive Improvements and Evolving Roles

The workshop also addressed the vital role of Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) in
maintaining the security and decentralization of the Cardano network.
Recognizing their importance, discussions were held around potential
improvements to the incentive structures that reward their contributions.

Furthermore, the workshop touched upon the evolving roles of SPOs within the
expanding Cardano ecosystem. The emergence of Layer 2 solutions like Hydra
and the framework for Actively Validated Services (AVS) for partner chains
opens up new opportunities for SPO participation beyond solely validating
Layer 1 transactions.

In this context, the idea of an SPO registry was discussed. This registry
would potentially list SPOs who are willing and capable of operating heads
in Layer 2 protocols like Hydra or acting as validators in partner chains
built using the AVS framework. This would allow projects and the broader
community to easily identify and engage with SPOs possessing the necessary
expertise and infrastructure for these advanced roles. Such a registry could
also inform future incentive mechanisms tailored to the responsibilities and
resource requirements of these new SPO functions, further strengthening the
ecosystem's scalability and interoperability.

Several suggestions for assessment regarding traditional SPO incentives were
also highlighted, including the introduction of a minimum margin parameter
that could be adjusted through governance, and modifications to the
pledge-benefit curve (the 'a0' parameter). These discussions acknowledged
the community's interest in exploring ways to further optimize SPO incentives
for the continued health and resilience of the Cardano network, alongside
these new avenues for SPO engagement.

## Strategic Partnerships and Ecosystem Growth

A recurring theme throughout the workshop was the critical role of strategic
partnerships in driving the adoption of Cardano and expanding its real-world
impact. Participants emphasized the importance of actively seeking collaborations
with organizations across various industries to develop and deploy Cardano-based
solutions that address specific needs and use cases. These partnerships are seen
as essential for reaching new user bases and demonstrating the tangible benefits
of Cardano's technology in practical applications.

### Layer 1 Enhancements: Scaling and Finality

Discussions around **Leios** centered on its potential to significantly
increase transaction throughput through parallel block creation. A key
trade-off explored was the increased complexity in consensus mechanisms and
potential implications for SPO resource utilization in endorsing and
processing multiple input blocks. The primary users who would benefit
directly from increased L1 throughput are applications requiring high
transaction volumes and users interacting with them. The impact on SPOs
involves adapting to the new block propagation and processing model,
potentially requiring adjustments to their infrastructure.

The exploration of **Peras** focused on accelerating transaction settlement
times via SPO voting. Trade-offs discussed included increased network traffic
due to voting and the need to achieve a sufficient voting quorum to ensure
consistent fast finality without frequent fallbacks to slower probabilistic
finality. Users would experience faster confirmation times, particularly
beneficial for time-sensitive transactions and interactions with exchanges.
SPOs would incur additional network overhead for voting, and the incentive
mechanisms for participation in the Peras voting process would be crucial
for its success.

### Layer 2 Solutions: Scaling Applications

**Hydra** and **Midgard** were discussed as critical frameworks for
enabling applications to scale effectively without placing excessive load
directly on Layer 1. Hydra's potential for off-chain head protocols and
Midgard's optimistic rollup approach were highlighted as key mechanisms for
achieving high-throughput and low-cost transactions for specific use cases,
thereby supporting ecosystem growth independently of immediate L1 scaling
limitations.

### Intent-Based Transactions: Efficiency and Security

**Intent-based transactions (nested transactions)** offer several key benefits,
including the potential for "batcher-less" decentralized exchanges and
significantly improved user onboarding through **Babel Fees**. Babel Fees would
allow users to pay transaction fees using non-ADA native assets, abstracting
away the current requirement of holding ADA to interact with the Cardano
network. This could lower the barrier to entry for new users and enhance the
usability of dApps. A potential trade-off involves increased complexity in
transaction construction and the need for robust tooling to support their
creation and interpretation. Users could experience more seamless
interactions with complex protocols and the ability to transact without
initially acquiring ADA. For security, as highlighted by "Checkpoint," intents
allow for pre-validation, potentially reducing malicious transactions but
introducing a dependency on the Checkpoint system or similar validators. The
trade-off here is the balance between proactive security and potential
centralization or reliance on specific validation services.

These advancements – L1 enhancements for base layer performance, L2 solutions
for application scaling, and intent-based transactions for both efficiency
and security – represent critical steps in realizing Cardano's vision for a
robust and scalable foundation for a decentralized global economy.

One key point identified by the participants was the importance of a split mempool
so nested transactions do not clog the ability to pass around completed transactions.
It was discussed that this could be done either as part of the node or a separate opt-in
service to accept and aggregate nested transactions.

## Conclusion: A Collaborative and Globally Inclusive Path to Market-Driven Advancement

The Cardano Vision Workshop in Paris served as a vital and productive forum
