# Aligning the Strategy for Cardano in Singapore/Japan

The intensive series of workshops held across Singapore and
Japan in September and October 2025 marked a pivotal moment
in charting Cardano's future. These
workshops collectively served to weave together a cohesive
strategic narrative, culminating in the foundational drafts
of the **Cardano 2030 Vision** and the comprehensive **2030**
**Strategic Plan**.
The ultimate objective guiding this strategy is clear: to
achieve **$200 million in annual Layer 1 (L1) revenue**,
ensuring Cardano's long-term economic self-sufficiency
.

The journey began in **Singapore**, where the focus was
placed squarely on **utility** and **technical assurance**
. This session was key in recalibrating
the vision to highlight Cardano's **robustness and high**
**assurance development methodology** as its core
differentiator within the Web3 space.
This highly successful workshop included diverse participants,
notably **representatives from SNEK**, contributing to the
strategic shift. This effort led
directly to the formalized **Vision Statement**: "Cardano is
the most secure, reliable and censorship-resistant blockchain
for mission critical applications to power economies of the
future". This vision is anchored by
the core values of Integrity, Community, Security, Utility,
and Accessibility.

The subsequent three workshops in **Japan**—held in Osaka
(sponsored by Zengate Global) and Tokyo—were critical in
**polishing the future strategy** and gave birth to the
conceptual framework of **Foundation and Pillars**
. These sessions, highly successful due
to broad participation including individuals outside the
Cardano community and a representative from the Cardano
Foundation, recognized that the strategy must extend **beyond**
**just a tech vision** to become a unifying vision for all of
Cardano.

The resulting **Strategic Plan** is built upon **Governance**
**and Community** as the foundational layer, stressing the
necessity of effective governance processes and a
"culture-first approach" to global engagement
. Success here will be rigorously
tracked by KPIs like DRep participation.

Upon this foundation rest the three essential pillars:

1.  **Adoption:** This pillar is dedicated to stimulating
    on-chain demand and utility across four key verticals:
    **Bitcoin DeFi**, **Real World Assets (RWA)**, **Supply**
    **Chain Traceability**, and **Payments**
   . The strategy is highly segmented,
    focusing on **Invisible Technology** and intuitive UX for
    End Users, enhancing developer support and documentation,
    addressing application-level security for large
    enterprises, and implementing culturally intelligent
    strategies for **Emerging Markets** in LATAM, Africa, and
    East Asia.
2.  **Ecosystem Sustainability:** This pillar ensures long-term
    economic health by planning to evolve the passive treasury
    into an **actively managed, multi-asset treasury** designed
    to generate yield and strategically deploy capital
   . It also prioritizes diversifying
    the roles of **Stake Pool Operators (SPOs)** and designing
    Layer 2 solutions to provide value back to the main chain
   .
3.  **Enabling Technology:** This area focuses on advancing the
    core protocol to support the strategic vision
   . Key technical areas include
    achieving world-class L1 Scalability and Finality (Leios
    24/7, Peras, Phalanx), integrating robust Layer 2 solutions
    (Hydra, Midgard), and ensuring seamless Interoperability
    (Midnight Partner Chains).

In conclusion, the Singapore and Japan workshops provided the
critical energy and diverse feedback necessary to solidify this
strategic direction. The documents now serve as a mandate for
the community to allocate resources effectively, driving focused
innovation and ensuring Cardano remains a dependable and
impactful platform capable of realizing its full potential by
2030.
