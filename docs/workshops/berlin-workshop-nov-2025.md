# Putting forth the Vision and Strategy for Cardano in Berlin

The strategic planning for Cardano's future, developed through
targeted workshops and internal alignment efforts, culminated
in the presentation of the draft strategy at the Berlin Summit
. This moment marked a crucial step toward
validating the new framework with the broader community and
**puts the vision and strategy well on its way to being**
**submitted on-chain**.

The process began with initial strategic discussions that
focused on establishing a robust economic goal for the network,
centered on achieving **$200 million USD in annual Layer 1**
**(L1) revenue**. This figure represented
the necessary financial foundation for the network's long-term
self-sufficiency. Leading up to the
Berlin Summit, there was a concerted effort among ecosystem
entities, which included a **collaborative discussion with the**
**Cardano Foundation (CF)**, resulting in a **major refactoring**
**and polishing** of the strategy framework. This ensured the
draft was comprehensive and ready for community scrutiny
.

The refined strategy was presented at a one-hour-long Day-0
workshop during the Cardano Summit in Berlin in November
. While the strategy is **not yet codified**
and remains a draft, the final **Cardano**
**2030 Strategic Plan** presented at the
summit adjusted the primary economic objective to sustaining
**400 million ADA in annual L1 revenue**.
The presentation received **very positive feedback** from a
diverse crowd. A soft poll conducted
afterwards showed strong community validation, with **about**
**two-thirds (2/3) of the crowd** indicating they would "get
behind that vision and strategy if it was put on-chain in its
current state".

The strategic architecture presented in Berlin is built upon a
Foundation and four Pillars:

* The **Foundation** is **Infrastructure & Research Excellence**
   . Its focus is on enhancing L1
    scalability, achieving Post-Quantum readiness, and
    implementing client diversity for resilience and security
   .
* **Pillar 1: Adoption & Utility**. This
    pillar aims to drive non-speculative on-chain demand across
    high-value verticals (DeFi, RWA, Supply Chain, and Payments),
    emphasizing enterprise-grade security and "Invisible
    technology" for simplified user experience
   .
* **Pillar 2: Governance**. This focuses
    on strengthening the DRep model through **role-based**
    **incentives**, implementing **Turnout-Aware Voting** to resist
    plutocratic capture, and using **Treasury Seasons** to combat
    voter fatigue.
* **Pillar 3: Community & Ecosystem Growth**.
    This seeks to cultivate a long-term talent pipeline via **Youth**
    **Engagement** and targeted **Localized adoption** in key
    emerging markets such as LATAM, Africa, and East Asia
   .
* **Pillar 4: Ecosystem Sustainability & Resilience**
   . This involves evolving the passive
    treasury into an **actively managed, multi-asset portfolio**
    with a **>10% ROI target**, and diversifying SPO roles to
    secure the network long-term.

The successful reception of this framework in Berlin validates
the strategic alignment achieved across ecosystem entities and
the community, positioning the draft plan for the next steps
toward formal ratification.
