# London - Community Workshop

## Introduction

On November 21st 2025, community members gathered in London-UK, to contribute their perspectives to Cardano's evolving 2030 Community Vision & Strategy. The session was organised and hosted by London SPO UPStream and facilitated by Product Committee Secretary Lorenzo Bruno. This document captures the key themes and insights shared by participants and reflects the collective sentiment of the session.

## Key Learnings and Insights

During the workshop the group reviewed collectively and provided feedback on the proposed vision and mission, and also the pillars that make the strategy with a particular focus on KPIs.

### Vision

There was general support around the overall structure and aim of the vision. Below are a few small suggested adjustments:

-   Using the word Decentralised brings more meaning with it  vs 'censorship resistant' 

-   Vision is forward looking, so it should be phrased as "To be the most secure, reliable...."  

-   We should review also the language of the constitution preamble  

-   "truly decentralised" could cover the censorship resistance point and open up to other Cardano decentralisation strengths

-   Censorship resistance is a core advantage, but only when achieved in a decentralised manner.

-   Greater decentralisation is a strong selling point but introduces its own operational and coordination challenges.

-   We need to add more clarity on who values these attributes: developers, enterprises, governments, NGOs, end-users?

-   Question raised: Does this vision translate to user-friendliness? Does a blockchain being secure and censorship-resistant inherently make it more or less usable?

### Mission

There was general support around the overall structure and aim of the mission, and agreement to the good alignment with the vision. Below are a few small suggested adjustments:
-   Should the mission only reflect building something new or should it be also about maintaining current and ensuring its essence and ethos is continued. 
    -   Consider dropping the word 'new' as might imply not addressing web2?   
    -   'New' does allude to the future which is still acceptable and implies 'doing things differently'.  
    -   Consider whether the phrase "new economies" is needed,  removing "new" might avoid excluding existing sectors.
-   Is government/NGO excluded by builder/business/community language?  
-   Concern: avoid sacrificing the current ecosystem in pursuit of speculative future ones.
-   Suggestion to simplify to "people" to avoid excluding important groups like governments, NGOs, regulators, institutions.
    -   Consider replacing the starting sentence with 'To grow a global ecosystem ...'  
-   Ensure terminology does not unintentionally narrow the ecosystem's scope.

### Strategy

There was general support around the overall structure of foundation and pillars of the strategy. Below are a few small suggested adjustments:
-   Suggest to change name of the doc from "Strategic Plan" to "High level Strategy Framework" (the plan will be the annual one)
-   Foundation: Infrastructure & Research Excellence
    -   Update "Economic" to "Transactional"
    -   Drives societal and economic impact (add to definition in the  Infrastructure and research base explanation wording)
    -   Could we think about changing wording for Infra and R&D? Instead of "Keeping Cardano secure, fast and interoperable" Have it as "Keeping Cardano secure (most important especially because we had block production delay today) while making it fast and interoperable" This would directly translate to KPI and tracking what speed upgrades we achieved (something I have not seen in the KPI section)
-   Pillar: Adoption & Utility
    -   Consider talking about lowering/removing  the barrier to access
    -   Does "non-speculative" mean stable ?
    -   Consider adding in about improving the system infrastructure to deliver value for its community
-   Pillar: Governance
    -   Governance should be self sustaining  
    -   Consider mentioning treasury funding model 
    -   Check CIP-1694 for better wording for "hard to capture"  
    -   Clarify what does "paced" (is it fast and responsive'? )
-   Pillar: Community & Ecosystem Growth
    -   Adoption starts at the bottom level. Consider wording on how empowering small communities, businesses will inevitably result in institutional adoption. Institutions won't come until we have a large base they can build value from.
    -   Adoption also comes from the simple use of transactions. Can I complete a task and only use ADA to do so? If this is a simple experience for the user we make it easy for them to perform 'day to day' trades using ADA
    -   Consider adding funding here to build engagement with the VC/wider investor landscape to incubate and invest in  next DApps

### KPIs
There was general support about current KPIs with a few suggested additions. Below are a few small suggested adjustments:
-   Add column for current state of these KPIs (also where are other chains)
-   Think of KPIs we are able to calculate now
-   Make sure to include the industry standard for these metrics
-   Keep this initial list high-level, and then allow the community to build the sub-KPIs
